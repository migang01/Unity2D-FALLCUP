# Unity2D-FALLCUP
&lt;Endless runner - WebGL>
First game as step stone to achieve dream about game that I’ve been held in my heart since I was in high school.
Simple endless runner type game, mobile build.

Move by touching.
Cup(player) automatically moves horizontally, if it touches the right edge of screen then face and go left, and again if it touches the left edge of screen then face and go right.
It jumps if player touches screen. But, it requires energy. So player has to collect some fruits to gain energy. Energy amount is different fruit by fruit, but if player is hit by rock then it loses energy. 
If cup falls because of 0 energy then it’s game over.
